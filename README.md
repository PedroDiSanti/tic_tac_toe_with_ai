# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI!

This project is a simple implementation of the popular game "Tic Tac Toe" developed in Python using the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

## Technology Used

- Python 3.10.4: Our version of choice due to its clear syntax, vast library support, and powerful features.
- Pytest: A testing framework for Python that allows the easy creation of simple and scalable tests.
- Coverage: A tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs

## How it Works

The game is run through the `run_game.py`, which emulates a computer against the player, validating and determining if a game-winning condition has been met on each move.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10.4 installed (you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository via the command prompt.
4. Generate a venv.
5. Install the requirements.txt file.
6. Run the command - `python run_game.py`.

## Testing

To run tests, ensure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`), navigate to the directory with the tests in your terminal, and run `pytest`. 

For the coverage file, run `python -m coverage run -m unittest` and then use `coverage report -m`.
